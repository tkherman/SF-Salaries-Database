We chose to design our API on the San Francisco Salaries Database. It has two
main dictionaries to store the data.

The first dictionary is named "employees".
It provides access to the information on every employee in the database which
includes Id, EmployeeName, JobTitle, BasePay, TotalPay, Year and Agency. The
database allows basic access to the dictionary such as getting information on a
specific employee, getting all employee ids, setting an employee infomation,
deleting a specific employee or clearing the entire dictionary

The second dictionary is named "jobs".
This dictionary allows the employee informations to be processed and provide
more interesting information to the user. It can list all jobs in the database,
get all employee ids of a specific job, get average total pay and base pay, get
the job with the best salary, and get the most popular job.

This API allows user to access and modify the database while getting more
updated informations on job prospect in San Francisco
